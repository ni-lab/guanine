tl;dr
------ 
clinvar-snv (aka cadd-clinvar-snv) is a single-nucleotide variant pathogenicity interpretation task, where models attempt to estimate the likelihood a reference-divergent sequence (i.e. a real, human haplotype) is implicated in a known disease (either germline or somatic). clinvar-snv is built on the eponymous ClinVar database, an American oft-cited clinical repository of (historically manual) variant interpretations. Due to intractable combination of longstanding structural issues in health equity, especially with respect to `diversity in genomics`_, and fundamental challenges in sampling size for manually curated (and corroborated) data, GUANinE intentionally declines to provide a training dataset based on ClinVar variants, and instead suggests constructing models by other means, perhaps by using GUANinE's deleteriousness task, cadd-snv (link), as a training proxy. 

The approximate statistical model is :math:`y_{X} \sim \lceil p(X) - p(\tilde{X}) - e\rceil` for  :math:`p` a likelihood of disease incidence over sequences :math:`X` (reference) and :math:`\tilde{X}` (variant); :math:`e` corresponds to a presumable threshold of detectability in terms of severity, medicalization, or social awareness. The ceiling function correspondingly transforms truly/nearly benign divergences from reference (as well as possibly protective effects) to the class of zero, while variants with pathogenic effects exceeding :math:`e` will be rounded upwards to one. 

Class labels are **boolean** and take the form of zero (0, benign) to one (1, pathogenic). Note that this dichotomy, while not entirely false, does not address fundamental issues about the nature of pathogenicity, e.g. variant penetrance, disease incidence, environmental interactions, and homozygosity and its role in allele dominance. 

interpretation
--------------
Variants and variant call files (VCFs) represent one of the most portable, sparsified representations of individual genotypes -- this convenience, along with the historic emphasis on linear, non-epistatic models (including GWAS), has led to a single-variant-centric approach to genetic disease interpretation. Of course, no genotype exists outside of its environment (life history, nutrition, social determinants of health, etc), so it should be recognized that variant interpretation techniques are most *clinically* useful in severe, highly penetrant, early-onset conditions and disorders, e.g. the 20th-century use of genetic testing and counseling for prospective couples who were carriers of `Tay-sachs disease`_. Outside of *clinical* settings, variant interpretation can be immensely useful for identifying potentially causal pathways, mechanisms, and druggability -- a key pharmaceutical research endeavor.  


build details 
-------------
To harmonize with existing variant interpretation research, clinvar-snv sourced its test set directly from `CADD`_ v1.4 - 1.7, one of the most-publicly-researched deleteriousness (and by correlation, pathogenicity) predictors. ClinVar variants dated from June 2023 were cross-indexed (intersected) with an August 2025 build of ClinVar, ensuring a degree of continuity and assuredness in labels (as a small percentage of variants are reclassified year-to-year). 

Due to the non-coding nature of GUANinE's research emphasis, non-UTR exonic regions (i.e. coding sequences, or 'CDS') were pruned from the data (over half of all SNVs). Intronic variants, and many splicing, transcription, and lncRNA-specific variants are retained (so mRNA-optimized models will likely outperform on certain subsets). 

The remaining 5,982 pathogenic variants in the test set were filtered through `gnomAD v4.1`_, where no variants exceeded a 1\% AF_grpmax across groups in gnomAD (high allele frequency is a common marker for misannotated variants). To control for obvious confounders, and to ensure the dataset's representativeness for rare variant interpretation, the remaining 28,900 benign variants underwent subsampling and distribution alignment via propensity score matching (`PSM`_, using optimal full matching) based on distance to nearest transcription start site (TSS), consequence (e.g. A>G, T>C), and group maximum allele frequency (AF_grpmax) to yield a balanced set of 5,982 benign variants distributed across chromosomes. 

The dev set was sourced from ClinVar variants *not* in CADD's test set (i.e. newly released variants, post-June 2023) and underwent a similar filtration and quality control process.
