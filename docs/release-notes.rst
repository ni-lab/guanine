=============
1.0.5 Release
=============

The 1.0 version of GUANinE launched with publication of the original `GUANinE v1.0`_ paper. This intermediate version, 1.0.X, is in preparation for the next major release, v1.1

Looking forward
---------------
v1.0.8 will include the completed, interactive leaderboard, while v1.0.9 will offer a 'models' section with commentary and terse yet informative analyses of individual models evaluated by the ``GUANinE`` team (aka eyes & Nilah).  

v1.1 will offer full support for three new tasks, `cadd_snv`_ (in progress), `cadd_indel`_ (in progress), and `clinvar_snv`_ (completed, but still under evaluation). Expect a preprint when we get a chance :3
