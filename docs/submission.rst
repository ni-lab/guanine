Submitting your test set predictions

[Automatic scoring is not yet live -- contact eyes or use the `Google Form`_]

.. tip::
    Never publish models/results because of "high test set" scores. Instead, publish your findings because of high *dev* set scores and take note of whether the model performance is lower on the test set (likely due to overfitting).
